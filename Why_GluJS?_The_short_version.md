##Why GluJS? The short version

Developing rich, reactive business-oriented web UIs turns out to be much more difficult than it first appears. For most enterprises, the smartest thing to do is to find a library that offers a rich UI component set - like Sencha ExtJS - to handle the complexities of laying out UI across browsers.

That's an excellent approach, but it doesn't necessarily get the job done. Tools like Sencha ExtJS offer steep learning curves even for experienced developers. Organizing large applications with rich reactive behavior can quickly lead to a tangle of code unless you are already an expert. Even with teams experienced in the tool, there isn't always an obvious way to organize the code so that it is concise and manageable and side-effect free.

Most problematic of all, there is no obvious out-of-the-box pain-free way to make the code testable as you go. The richer the application, the more you end up plugging holes.

GluJS is for anyone who is trying to build a rich web HTML UI using a declarative widget toolset like Sencha ExtJS. It dramatically simplifies the architecture and reduces code to a minimum while getting out of the way to let ExtJS shine. Non-experts can now be productive, while experts can drop all of the boiler-plate code and concentrate on the application itself.

Best of all, it is "test-driven" from the ground up so that all of your UI code -- from user interactions to AJAX calls -- can be simulated in a fast and developer-friendly test harness.
