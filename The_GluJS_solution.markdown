##The GluJS solution

GluJS directly addresses the needs of enterprise developers:

###Test-first out-of-the box
GluJS provides a test specification methodology (backed by Jasmine) that captures and turn complex UI behavior provided by stakeholders into actionable code and automated tests. To make sure that the tests correspond to user stories in the real world, gluJS provides a test library that provides full transparent AJAX mocking and dummy data. 

####Fast UI cycles even if the server-side is incomplete
Client developers no longer have to wait to get back to the stakeholders. A rich, simple Ajax back-end simulator lets you jump immediately into producing tested UI code. It also lets developers return the client application back to stakeholders for feedback and review -- perhaps before the actual server is even started. Pointing back to an actual server is later a single configuration switch.

####Tight, organized DRY code
GluJS lets you write minimalistic UI-oriented code. Out-of-the box UI patterns like enabling/disabling action buttons based on UI state combined with conventions that automatically wire components together greatly reduces repetitive code, letting the application underneath emerge.

####Enterprise-ready localization and access rights
Localization is not an optional add-on to gluJS, but built-in to the core. As long as you provide the translations in a local file, everything is localized automatically. Plus, GluJS's support for dynamic global control customizations makes it simple to manage global access control patterns like enable/disabling/hiding controls based on user privileges.

####Strong reusable design patterns for distributed teams
Though a great start, the MVC pattern is little more than a pattern for wiring up handlers. The patterns built into gluJS directly address higher-level real-world UI interactions. Since the patterns are so strong, there's a known best way to approach most problems. That helps keep the design of the application unified even with very different developers. And of course that makes for a less-costly, more supportable application.

####Get the most out of best-of-breed HTML 5 graphic libraries
Libraries like Sencha ExtJS provide a rich, clean look and feel, utilities, and Ajax connectivity. GluJS provides the "glue" that brings these pieces together for testable, fast enterprise development.

####Drops in place into existing projects
We realize that as an enterprise developer you are often fitting your application into a larger portal or shell. GluJS has multiple entry points that let you drop your application into a larger one, or write the entire app in gluJS.
